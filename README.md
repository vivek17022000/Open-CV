#Description
<p>This program explains how to do object detection (face and eyes) using OpenCV on Python. Firstly, I imported some Haar Cascade files. These kind of files are very useful to perform object detection on common elements such as face, vehicles, eyes, facial expressions, and so on.</p>

# Face-Detection
<p>Face detection is a technique that identifies or locates human faces in digital images. A typical example of face detection occurs when we take photographs through our smartphones, and it instantly detects faces in the picture. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection detects merely the presence of faces in an image while facial recognition involves identifying whose face it is.</p>
